# Lessons learned implementing Story 1: Basic Navigation

Mutability is a tricky concept. I didn't want to use it at all, but I could not figure out another way to handle keeping track of the character's status. That is probably the one place where it is OK.

The problem is, once you introduce mutability, functions don't quit work as expected. It seems that F# will assume that if you call a function with the same parameters (or if it has no parameters) it will always return the same value. This of course is not the case when it is getting keyboard input. That definitely throws things out of whack. So, the lesson is, be careful with mutability.
