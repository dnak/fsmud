So we have a project all initialized and it does something. Nothing interesting, yet. Time to implement a real feature: navigation.

To start with, we are going to assume that you are in the middle of a large field that stretches infinitely in all directions. At any time you can walk one frame in any of the basic cardinal directions: North, South, East, or West. To start we will accept only the full word version of these commands. In lieu of a map we will display your coordinate position, with the starting frame being (0, 0).

My starting hypothesis of how to handle this is to create a structure that holds your name and your current position. This will be passed in to the navigation function, which will wait for input. When it gets valid input, it will determine your new position, create a new structure with the new position, and return it. This will be contained in a loop that will continue. To simplify our code and give us a nice way to close the application, we will also accept Quit as a command.
